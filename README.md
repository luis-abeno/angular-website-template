# Angular website template

Angular base template for a responsive website.

# About the template

This template is a base for a angular website, it has some basic features to get started.
I tried to keep it as simple and small using less libraries as possible, only angular material.
The idea is to deliver a good user experience and keep the website clean and small.

1. Clone the repository
